# RunLater plugin

Call any URL at an exact time or on a cron schedule from your coding agent. [RunLater](https://runlater.app) retries failures and keeps a log of each run's status code, timing and response.

This repository holds the plugin config and agent skill. The MCP server is hosted at `https://runlater.app/api/mcp`.

## Install

Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add runlater-app/runlater-plugin
/plugin install runlater@runlater
```

Or add only the MCP server:

```
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user runlater https://runlater.app/api/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` and sign in. [Setup for claude.ai, Cursor, VS Code, Codex and Windsurf](https://runlater.app/docs/mcp).
